Install
=======
Warcprox runs on python 3.4+.

To install latest release run:

::

    # apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev
    pip install warcprox

You can also install the latest bleeding edge code:

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/internetarchive/warcprox.git


Trusting the CA cert
====================
For best results while browsing through warcprox, you need to add the CA
cert as a trusted cert in your browser. If you don't do that, you will
get the warning when you visit each new site. But worse, any embedded
https content on a different server will simply fail to load, because
the browser will reject the certificate without telling you.

API
===
For interacting with a running instance of warcprox.

* ``/status`` url
* ``WARCPROX_WRITE_RECORD`` http method
* ``Warcprox-Meta`` http request header and response header

See `<api.rst>`_.

Deduplication
=============
Warcprox avoids archiving redundant content by "deduplicating" it. The process
for deduplication works similarly to heritrix and other web archiving tools.

1. while fetching url, calculate payload content digest (typically sha1)
2. look up digest in deduplication database (warcprox supports a few different
   ones)
3. if found, write warc ``revisit`` record referencing the url and capture time
   of the previous capture
4. else (if not found),

   a. write warc ``response`` record with full payload
   b. store entry in deduplication database

The dedup database is partitioned into different "buckets". Urls are
deduplicated only against other captures in the same bucket. If specified, the
``dedup-bucket`` field of the ``Warcprox-Meta`` http request header determines
the bucket, otherwise the default bucket is used.

Deduplication can be disabled entirely by starting warcprox with the argument
``--dedup-db-file=/dev/null``.

Statistics
==========
Warcprox keeps some crawl statistics and stores them in sqlite or rethinkdb.
These are consulted for enforcing ``limits`` and ``soft-limits`` (see
`<api.rst#warcprox-meta-fields>`_), and can also be consulted by other
processes outside of warcprox, for reporting etc.

Statistics are grouped by "bucket". Every capture is counted as part of the
``__all__`` bucket. Other buckets can be specified in the ``Warcprox-Meta``
request header. The fallback bucket in case none is specified is called
``__unspecified__``.

Within each bucket are three sub-buckets:

* ``new`` - tallies captures for which a complete record (usually a ``response``
  record) was written to warc
* ``revisit`` - tallies captures for which a ``revisit`` record was written to
  warc
* ``total`` - includes all urls processed, even those not written to warc (so the
  numbers may be greater than new + revisit)

Within each of these sub-buckets we keep two statistics:

* ``urls`` - simple count of urls
* ``wire_bytes`` - sum of bytes received over the wire, including http headers,
  from the remote server for each url

For historical reasons, in sqlite, the default store, statistics are kept as
json blobs::

    sqlite> select * from buckets_of_stats;
    bucket           stats
    ---------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    __unspecified__  {"bucket":"__unspecified__","total":{"urls":37,"wire_bytes":1502781},"new":{"urls":15,"wire_bytes":1179906},"revisit":{"urls":22,"wire_bytes":322875}}
    __all__          {"bucket":"__all__","total":{"urls":37,"wire_bytes":1502781},"new":{"urls":15,"wire_bytes":1179906},"revisit":{"urls":22,"wire_bytes":322875}}

Plugins
=======
Warcprox supports a limited notion of plugins by way of the ``--plugin``
command line argument. Plugin classes are loaded from the regular python module
search path. They will be instantiated with one argument, a
``warcprox.Options``, which holds the values of all the command line arguments.
Legacy plugins with constructors that take no arguments are also supported.
Plugins should either have a method ``notify(self, recorded_url, records)`` or
should subclass ``warcprox.BasePostfetchProcessor``. More than one plugin can
be configured by specifying ``--plugin`` multiples times.
